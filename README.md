The game will start upon pressing the "Start" button. Once
the button is pressed the words will start falling from the 
top of the screen. The player's goal is to type these words
in the input field as fast as possible before the words fall
to the bottom of the screen. 

When the user has missed typing 10 words, the game will auto-
matically end and the score, typed words, typed characters,
and the correctly typed words will be displayed.

Enjoy!
